# Multidimensional Building Data Cube Pattern Identification

This work proposes a multi-dimensional analytical method grounded on a generic data mining framework for building data analysis. It puts together reviewed analytics best practices in a step-wise method tailored to DM application for systematic knowledge discovery in big building data. 

Contributions of this work can be summarized as three-fold:
* Framing a multi-dimensional analytical approach leveraging the data-cube structure, cutting down complexity endowed from high-dimensional building data, 
* Put forward a generic building-tailored Data Mining framework and, 
* Appeal to benchmarking methods for reproducible, comparable & empirically validated analytics.

## Getting Started

The directory is divided in sub-folders. Each of which contains the relative source code. Just clone this repository on your computer or Fork it on GitHub

### Source Data

This research uses the open [building-data-genome-project-2](https://github.com/buds-lab/building-data-genome-project-2) data set, available on github. Only the raw data from the BDG2 set are extracted. Cleaned data are then stored under the 'data/' folder.

>It **SHOULD NOT** containc identifiable data. 

### Data Analysis

Please save your source code in the `code` folder. Currently you can find an example of a Python, R and Jupiter notebook in this folder.

> Figures and Tables to be used in the manuscript should be saved in the  respective folder `manuscript/src/figures` or `manuscript/src/tables`.
